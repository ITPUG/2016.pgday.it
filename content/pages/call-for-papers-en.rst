The deadline for submissions is 23:59 (UTC+2) on
**Saturday 22 October 2016**; proponents of selected talks will
be notified by **Saturday 29 October 2016**.

Each proposal must include the following information:

* Proposal type (talk/tutorial)
* Title
* Abstract, including notes for the committee, if any
* Language (Italian/English)
* Author names and affiliations
* A short profile of each author
* Speaker(s) name(s)
* Other conferences (past or future) to which the same proposal has been submitted
* Resources required for the presentation (internet access, video, audio, etc.)
* Additional resources provided to attendees, if any (slides, code, etc.)


Confirmed speakers will be offered a free entrance to the
conference, including lunch and coffee breaks.
Normally we do not refund other expenses, such as travel or
accommodation; however we may consider specific cases,
in which case a detailed request must be included in the
submitted proposal.

Speakers will prepare all the resources required for their
presentation(s); slides must be made available to the
conference attendees using a suitable licence
(e.g. Creative Commons).

Confirmed speakers will register to the conference using
the information (website, credentials) that will be
communicated in due course.

Proposals will be evaluated by a committee composed by
Matteo Beccati, Matteo Durighetto (President), Torello Querci,
Andrej Sossi and Emanuele Zamprogno.

The committee may request additional information whenever
appropriate. All presentations must be prepared according to
the guidelines which will be sent to confirmed speakers.
